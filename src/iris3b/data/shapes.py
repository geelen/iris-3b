"""Shape policies: the single seam that decides what (H, W) a sample trains at.

A policy answers two questions for one sample, from its native size alone:

- ``target`` — the (height, width) the sample is resized/cropped to;
- ``key`` — the grouping token used to assemble shape-homogeneous batches.

Everything downstream (dataset transform, batch sampler, collate, trainer)
consumes only that pair, so the batching strategy is a configuration choice
rather than an architectural commitment:

- ``fixed`` — one square size, one key.
- ``bucket`` — snap to the nearest entry of a hand-written aspect-ratio table.
- ``area`` — no table: preserve the native ratio, round both sides to a
  multiple of ``align`` under a token budget, and let the realized shape set be
  whatever the corpus contains.
