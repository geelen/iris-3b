"""Positional seeding: every stochastic draw is a pure function of position.

Training randomness (timesteps, noise, dropout masks, caption choice) is keyed
on (seed, rank, epoch, position) instead of an ambient RNG stream, so a resumed
run reproduces the unbroken run bit-exactly from any checkpoint.
