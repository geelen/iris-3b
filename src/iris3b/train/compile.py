"""torch.compile application, shape budgeting, and recompilation telemetry.

Dynamo caches one compiled graph per set of guards, and a run that produces
many input shapes needs one cache entry per shape. When a frame exceeds
``torch._dynamo.config.recompile_limit`` (default 8) dynamo gives up on that
frame *permanently* and runs it eager for the rest of the process, after having
already paid autotuning for the first few shapes. Nothing raises and nothing is
printed at warning level unless the user happened to enable dynamo logging, so
the failure mode is a run that quietly gets slower than eager would have been.

Two mechanisms remove that:

- the cache budget is sized from the number of shapes the run will actually
  produce, read from the data shape policy rather than guessed;
- ``recompile_count`` reports guard failures out of dynamo's own bookkeeping so
  the trainer can log recompilations as a metric and shout once when a frame
  crosses its budget.

Compiling per block instead of per model also shrinks the blast radius: each
block is a separate frame with its own cache line, so N shapes cost N small
graphs per block instead of N whole-model graphs, and the autotune cost is paid
once per block shape rather than once per (H, W) grid.
