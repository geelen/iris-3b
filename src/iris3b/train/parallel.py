"""Data-parallel strategy construction: DDP and FSDP2 from one config.

Nothing here holds run state. Every entry point is a pure function of
``train.dist`` (plus the model config where the topology is model-derived), so
the layer is unit-testable without a process group; ``torch.distributed`` is
imported only inside the functions that need a live world.

The strategies differ in what crosses the network per step. DDP moves
``2M(W-1)/W`` bytes of gradient, FSDP full sharding ``3M(W-1)/W`` of parameter
and gradient, and hybrid sharding keeps the all-gathers inside one shard group
and sends only ``~2(M/G)(R-1)/R`` between groups, which is why the mesh exists.
