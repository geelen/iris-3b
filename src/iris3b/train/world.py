"""Torchrun world topology: read it, prove it is one world, print it.

A hand-rolled ``torchrun --nproc_per_node=8`` started on two machines produces
two *unrelated* process groups, each with ranks 0..7, each convinced its world
size is 8. Both halves then walk the same data range and both elect a rank-0
checkpoint writer, so the run trains duplicate samples and the checkpoint is
whichever half wrote last. Nothing raises. ``assert_single_world`` exists to
turn that into a startup failure.
